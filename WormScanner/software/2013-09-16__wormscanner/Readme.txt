WormScanner makes use of WormTracker as a library (jar file).
In order to compile WormScanner using ANT, 
please get the WormTracker.jar file
from: http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/wormtracker/ 
and place it inside the 'lib' folder 
(the name should be WormTracker.jar)

If you are not using ant to compile, then include WormTracke.jar as 
one of the required JAR libraries in the classpath.
