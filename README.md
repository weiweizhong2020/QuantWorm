# QuantWorm
This is a collection of the computational tools that my lab developed for C. elegans image analysis during 2008-2018. These tools are open-source and have been published in various journals as listed in References below. 

The QuatWorm_User_Manual file and the Experimental_protocol files show how to use these computational tools and how to perform experiments to prepare the worms to get best images. 

Each tool has its own directory. In each tool directory, the "software" folder contains the codes; the "sample" folder contains the sample data for analysis.

## WormScanner
Function: Acquisition of Images and/or Videos. 
Please see the instructions folder in WormScanner for installation details before installing .

## WormLength
Function: Analysis of worm length.

## WormLifespan
Function: Analysis of worm life span.

## WormEgg
Function: Count worm eggs.

## WormLocomotion
Function: Analysis of worm locomotion.

## WormGender
Function: Count hermaphrodite and male worms.

## WormCounter
Function: Count worms in a chemotaxis plate assay.

## WormTrapAssay
Function: Count worms in a chemotaxis trap assay.
